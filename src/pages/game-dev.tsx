      `We create games for mobile platforms, consoles and desktop computers, and deals with design development to development and support in the market. The game is a billion hypotheses that you know about at the start of development, and another 100 billion factors that you will find out about when you release the product, or you will not find out at all. We are driven by the desire and motivation to create the best products, because the development process is long and requires many complex solutions. In GameDev, the product can be constantly processed and improved. The reason for this is that the final vision of the product may differ due to the abundance of ideas. We learn what our audience likes through experimentation and constant analysis.`.toUpperCase(),
