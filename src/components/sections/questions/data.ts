    text: 'How is the work organized in the Crocode Team?',
    answer:
      'At the beginning, we always formulate an understanding of the task. To do this, we conduct a series of interviews with the client. The result of the work is a technical task that describes how the project will look like. At this stage, we can give you an accurate estimate of the time and budget for system designs and an approximate estimate for development. Then, we prepare the designs of the future project (if you already have layouts, this stage is skipped). We start by designing the future product — we prepare wireframes. The result of this stage is the rendered designs of the future product. The final stage is Delivery. At this stage we are engaged in programming: wireframes, frontend and backend. We also conduct QA testing of the project to make sure that all the scenarios of the project have been taken into account, and everything is working efficiently. All communication, starting from the second stage of the project implementation, is conducted through PM, this allows you to always have a responsible person from our team who makes the development process transparent and understandable for you.',
